            <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence. <br> 
            Artificial defines "man-made", and Intelligence defines "thinking power" or the ability to learn and solve problems" 
            hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power." So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as 
            the branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think 
            like humans, and able to make decisions.

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>What is an IOT? <br> <br> The Internet of Things (IOT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with 
                electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. <br> <br>
                How does IOT wok? <br> <br> An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors 
                and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor 
                data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed 
                or analyzed locally. <br> <br> Four major components of IOT:
            </p>

                <ul class="components">
                    <li>Sensing Layer</li>
                    <li>Network Layer</li>
                    <li>Data Processing Layer</li>
                    <li>Application Layer</li>
                </ul>

                <p><br>What are an IOT Devices? <br> <br> IoT devices are pieces of hardware, such as sensors, actuators, gadgets, appliances, 
                    or machines, that are programmed for certain applications and can transmit data over the internet or other networks. They can 
                    be embedded into other mobile devices, industrial equipment, environmental sensors, medical devices, and more. <br> <br>
                    Example of an IoT Device: <br> <br> - Connected devices are part of an ecosystem in which every device talks to other 
                    related devices in an environment to automate home and industry tasks. They can communicate usable sensor data to users,
                    businesses and other intended parties. <br> <br> What Is an IoT Network? <br> <br> An IoT network refers to a collection of 
                    devices such as sensors, gadgets, appliances, and software that communicate with each other and exchange information and data 
                    without the need for human intervention. <br> <br> Three Common Types of IoT Networks:

            <p>Augmented Reality is a combination of real scene viewed by a user and virtual scene genrated by a computer that 
                augments the scene with an additional information. It is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved 
                through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and delivered via technology.
                Examples are: Pokemon Go and IKEA Products. <br>
                Vitual Reality is the term used for computer generated 3D environments that allow the user to enter and interact with 
                alternate realities. <br> <br> Types of Vitual Reality:
            </p>
                <ul class="components">
                    <li>Immersive - a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. (e.g. Flying in a parachute)</li>
                    <li>Non Immersive - large display but doesn't surround the user. (e.g. Playing golf on a screen)</li>
                    <li>Windows - desktop-based VR involves displaying a 3D virtual on regular desktop display without use of any 
                        specialized movement tracking environment. <br> Output Devices: Headset, 3D audio, Sensing gloves.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mixed Reality is an emergement technology that blends Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. These days, mixed reality 
                    describes environments in which real and virtual subjects and objects interact in real time - and in which you can interact 
                    with both real and virtual components. This requires a headset that has either a transparent lens or a camera, so that 
                    you can still see the real world. Note that the Windows Mixed Reality headset is a VR headset with a camera.

        <div class="topic-text">
            <p>What is Big Data? <br> <br> Big Data is also data but with a huge size. Big Data is a term used to describe a 
                collection of data that is huge in volume yet growing exponentially with time. That means, Data is so large and complex that 
                none of the traditional data management tools are able to store it or process it efficiently. <br> <br> Six V's of Big Data:

            <p>Types of Big Data:</p>

                <ul class="components">
                    <li>Structured - Structured is one of the types of big data. We mean data that can be processed, stored, and retrieved in 
                        a fixed format. It refers to highly organized information that can be readily and seamlessly stored and accessed from 
                        a database by simple search engine algorithms. (e.g. Employee table in a company database)
                    </li>
                    <li>Unstructured - Any data with unknown form or the structure is classified as unstructured data. In addition to the 
                        size being huge, unstructured data poses multiple challenges in terms of its processing for deriving value out of it. 
                        (e.g. An output returned by 'Google Search')
                    </li>
                    <li>Semi-Structured - can contain both the forms of data. We can see semi-structured data as a structured in form 
                        but it is actually not defined with. (e.g. A data represented in an XML file.)

                <p>What is Cluster Computing? <br> <br> A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely connected computers that works 
                    together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system. Clusters are commonly connected through fast 
                    local area networks. <br> <br> Advantages of Cluster Computing:

                <p><br>What is Quantum Computing? <br> <br> Quantum Computing is a type of computing that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics 
                    to perform operations on data. In contrast to classical computers, which use binary digits (bits) to represent information, 
                    quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which can represent a combination of states simultaneously, allowing for 
                    exponentially faster computations. <br> <br>
                    In quantum computing, operations are performed on qubits using quantum gates, which manipulate the state of the qubits. These 
                    gates can be used to create complex quantum circuits that perform calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum 
                    computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning, as well as 
                    enable new types of scientific simulations that are currently impossible. <br> <br> Advantages of Quantum Computing:
